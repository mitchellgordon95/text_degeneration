  to Australia , in November 1947 , he became Director of Training at RAAF Headquarters
  . In November 1950 , Headlam was appointed to take over command of No. 90 ( Composite
  ) Wing from Group Captain Paddy Heffernan . Headquartered at RAF Changi , Singapore
  , No. 90 Wing controlled RAAF units operating during the Malayan Emergency : No.
  1 ( Bomber ) Squadron , flying Avro Lincolns , and No. 38 ( Transport ) Squadron

  over communist @-@ held territory , as well as strikes against pinpoint targets
  . The Dakotas were tasked with courier flights , VIP transport and medical evacuations
  across South East Asia , and in Malaya with airlifting troops and cargo , dropping
  supplies to friendly forces and despatching propaganda leaflets . Headlam was slightly
  injured on 20 December , when a No. 38 Squadron Dakota he was co @-@ piloting on
  a supply drop crash @-@ landed at Kampong Aur in Pahang , following engine failure
  . In August 1951 he was named commander of RAF Tengah , Singapore , in addition
  to his post as commanding officer of No. 90 Wing . Headlam handed over command of
  No. 90'
- November he was posted to RAAF Overseas Headquarters , London , and the following
  year undertook studies at the Imperial Defence College . Returning to Australia
  , he served as acting Air Member for Personnel at the Department of Air , Canberra
  , from 19 March to 21 October 1957 , between the terms of Air Vice Marshals Fred
  Scherger and Allan Walters , and again from 24 August 1959 to 28 March 1960 , between
  the terms of Walters and Air Vice Marshal Bill Hely . In this role Headlam occupied
  a seat on the Air Board , the service 's controlling body that comprised its senior
  officers and was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff . He was also one of two
  RAAF representatives to serve on a committee , chaired by businessman William John
  Allison , examining conditions of defence service ; the committee 's recommendations
  led to a doubling of flight pay , among other improvements . Headlam 's other positions
  at the Department of Air included Air Commodore Plans from October 1957 to January
  1959 , and Director General Plans and Policy from January to August 1959 . The latter
  assignment put him in charge of the RAAF 's Directorate of Intelligence . Headlam
  was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) in the 1958
  Queen 's Birthday Honours , gazetted on 3 June . In May 1960 he became
- Air Staff ( DCAS ) on 26 January 1965 . He was appointed a Companion of the Order
  of the Bath ( CB ) " in recognition of distinguished service in the Borneo Territories
  " on 22 June . His tenure as DCAS coincided with the most significant rearmament
  program the Air Force had undertaken since World War II , and with manpower shortages
  stemming from this expansion and from Australia 's increasing involvement in the
  security of South East Asia . The first RAAF helicopters were committed to the Vietnam
  War towards the end of his term , and he travelled to Saigon with the Chief of the
  General Staff , Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton , in March 1966 to plan the deployment
  . The year before , Wilton had recommended to Air Marshal Murdoch , the Chief of
  the Air Staff , that two Iroquois be sent to Vietnam for familiarisation purposes
  ; Murdoch had rebuffed Wilton , and the RAAF helicopter squadron was considered
  underprepared for its army co @-@ operation role when it finally did deploy . Headlam
  succeeded Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy as AOC Support Command , Melbourne , on
  8 August 1966 . Support Command had been formed in 1959 , by merging the RAAF 's
  former Training and Maintenance Commands . On 1 January 1968 , Headlam was posted

  character in nearly all Naruto video games , including the Clash of Ninja series
  and the Ultimate Ninja series . In some games , he utilizes variations of his Shadow

- '''s character . IGN stated that Shikamaru was one of their favorite characters
  in the series , and referred to him as " the poster child for any card @-@ carrying
  member of Generation X " due to his general lack of enthusiasm and his unwillingness
  to utilize his potential . In a review of episode 110 , IGN praised how Shikamaru
  managed to transcend his lazy nature in order to take on the mantle of a leader
  when assigned to lead a team in order to retrieve Sasuke Uchiha and agreed that
  the decision to make him Chunin was fair . Anime News Network also commented on
  this development , calling Shikamaru ''s emergence as " an unlikely hero " one of
  the highlights of the arc . In a subsequent review of episode 135 , in which the
  mission to retrieve Sasuke has failed and the members of Shikamaru ''s team were
  critically injured , IGN lauded the " great moment " in the episode in which Shikamaru
  began to cry after learning his friends will recover , and declared that he will
  be a better leader for the sake of his friends . Mania Entertainment ''s Justin
  Rich celebrated his " sheer intellect " , calling him " one of the most fascinating
  characters in the series " and " one of the few truly brilliant fighters in shōnen

- turn of the last century . Architecture students from around the nation and Canada
  are known to visit Meridian in groups as part of their coursework due to numerous
  structures in the city having been designed by noted architects . The only home
  in the US south designed by noted Canadian born Architect Louis S. Curtiss , famous
  for inventing the glass curtain wall skyscraper , is extant on Highland Park . The
  Frank Fort designed Threefoot Building is generally considered one of the best Art
  Deco skyscrapers in the US and is often compared to Detroit 's famed Fisher Building
  . Noted California Architect Wallace Neff designed a number of homes in Meridian
  as well as in the Alabama Black Belt which adjoins the city across the nearby Alabama
  State line . He had relatives in Meridian and Selma who were executives in the then
  thriving railroad industry and would take commissions in the area when commissions
  in California were lean . His work is mostly concentrated in the lower numbered
  blocks of Poplar Springs Drive where his 2516 Poplar Springs Drive is often compared
  to the similarly designed Falcon Lair , the Beverly Hills home in Benedict Canyon
  of Rudolph Valentino . One Neff work was lost to an expansion of Anderson Hospital
  in 1990 and another in Marion Park burned in the 1950s . The Meridian Post Office

  $ 4 million in funding if private contributors could raise $ 8 million . The city
  donated $ 50 @,@ 000 to the cause in September 2007 . The MAEC , as proposed , would
  be located on 175 acres ( 71 ha ) at Bonita Lakes and consist of an outdoor amphitheatre
  , an indoor concert hall , and a Hall of Fame honoring Mississippi artists . The
  Hall of Fame will be located downtown in the old Montana 's building . That property
  and the adjacent Meridian Hotel building were acquired in July 2010 for $ 300 @,@
  000 . In February 2009 , the MAEC revealed its Walk of Fame outside of the Riley
  Center in an attempt to promote the planned Hall of Fame . The first star on the
  walk was dedicated to Jimmie Rodgers , a Meridian native . In September of the same
  year , the second star was revealed , recognizing B.B. King , a famous blues musician
  from Mississippi . On June 1 , 2010 , authors Tennessee Williams , Eudora Welty
  , and William Faulkner were added to the walk . Sela Ward was added to the walk
  on June 24 , 2010 . The MAEC plans to add many more Mississippi @-@ born stars to
  the Walk of Fame ; names mentioned include
- the corner of 7th Street and 26th Avenue . The city originally had two Carnegie
  libraries , both built in 1913 – one for blacks and one for whites . A group of
  women had formed the Fortnightly Book and Magazine Club in the 1880s and began raising
  money to build a library for the city . The books they collected and shared within
  the club were later the basis of the library collection for Meridian . With wide
  support for the library , the club enlisted Israel Marks , a city leader , to approach
  the national philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding assistance . The library
  for blacks was built at 13th Street and 28th Avenue on land donated by St. Paul
  Methodist Church , and the library for whites was established in a building originally
  owned by members of the First Presbyterian Church of Meridian , who sold it to the
  city on September 25 , 1911 . The African American library was the only library
  for blacks in the state until after World War I and is the only Carnegie library
  ever built for African Americans in the country . The two libraries served the city
  until 1967 , when the institutions became integrated because of the Civil Rights
  Act of 1964 , combined their collections , and moved all materials to their current
  location . The former white library was renovated and converted into the Meridian
  Museum of

  and could never decide when it was right . " The songs were developed with a remixed
  perspective in mind . Madonna commented that , " Whenever I make records , I often
  like the remixes better than the original ones . [ ... ] So I thought , screw that
  . I 'm going to start from that perspective " . She promoted the album at the dance
  party " Misshapes " held at Luke & Leroy 's nightclub in Greenwich Village , invited
  by Junior Sanchez to take over the DJ booth where she mixed " Hung Up " with " Sorry
  " . Musically , " Sorry " is an uptempo dance song containing layers of beats and
  strong vocal on the chorus . It is set in common time with a moderately fast dance
  groove tempo of 132 beats per minute . Composed in the key of C minor , Madonna
  's vocal range spans from F3 to G4 . It follows the chord progression of E ♭ – Cm
  – A ♭ – B ♭ during the spoken introduction . It then changes to Fm – Gm @-@ Cm in
  the chorus , while continuing in A ♭ – Cm – A

  Vineyard went on to say that it " ... wistfully evokes the sounds of the '' 80s
  @-@ era dance clubs that first lofted her toward stardom . " According to a review
  in the BBC ''s Collective , " New single '' Sorry '' states Queen Madge ''s unapologetic
  stance , and though the song is wrapped up in relationship sentiment , one cannot
  help but hear the subtext , perhaps directed at her more savage critics : '' there
  are more important things than hearing you speak '' . " Alan Braidwood from BBC
  Music called the song " lethally catchy " . Mike Pattenden of The Times and Sal
  Cinquemani from Slant Magazine noted that the bassline of the song utilizes The
  Jacksons '' 1980 song " Can You Feel It " . The song was noted by Slant Magazine
  as one of the best songs of 2006 . In a review of " Sorry " from Virgin Media ,
  it wrote that the song ''s musicscape features an " infectious combo of pumping
  , filtered synths and disco beats " . Keith Caulfield from Billboard commented that
  , " [ Sorry ] should keep fans hung up on Madonna ''s ability to create instant
  radio and club classics . " He also called the song " springy " while reviewing'
- '@-@ old Richmond took the car onto Lakeville Speedway at Lakeville , Ohio for some
  practice laps . " Somebody put a stopwatch on me , " Richmond said . " I was running
  laps faster than Dave had been . It was the first time I had ever driven a race
  car . " Richmond and his father found a red , white and blue @-@ colored No. 98
  car in Pennsylvania , which was the same number and paint scheme that Richmond used
  on model cars as a child . In his first competition at the track , officials placed
  Richmond in the slowest heat . He passed several cars before spinning out and breaking
  an axle . Although he made several attempts to get the car pointed in the right
  direction , the broken axle prevented the car from driving straight . After being
  towed to the pits , he parked the car for the rest of the event . Later that season
  , they towed the car to Eldora Speedway , only to have Richmond crash the car again
  . In response , Richmond ''s father fired him as the driver . The next season ,
  Al Richmond bought a SuperModified better suited to his son ''s driving style .

- suffered a 64 @-@ race winless streak that was finally broken at the Van Scoy Diamond
  Mine 500 at Pocono in June 1986 . After two straight second @-@ place finishes at
  Charlotte and Riverside , Richmond started the Pocono event in third place inside
  the second row . That race saw a caution for rain with five laps left before the
  halfway point . NASCAR wanted the cars to get to the halfway point to make the race
  official , so the sanctioning body had the drivers slowly circle the track . It
  took the drivers 26 minutes to complete the laps , and the rain was so heavy that
  some drivers had to look out their side windows because they could not see out their
  windshields . Two hours later , the track had dried and the race resumed with Richmond
  in third . After Richmond 's car was adjusted to remove the " push " , the car was
  more to his liking . Because his radio did not work , he was unable to communicate
  with his crew chief , Hyde , and he made his final pit stop with 37 laps left .
  Hyde worried that Richmond had stopped a lap too early to ensure that he would have
  enough fuel to make it to the end .

- loaded onto slow transport ships for the rest of the trip to Guadalcanal . Because
  of the damage caused by Allied air attack to a separate troop convoy during the
  Battle of the Eastern Solomons , the Japanese decided not to deliver Kawaguchi 's
  troops to Guadalcanal by slow transport ship ; instead , the ships carrying Kawaguchi
  's soldiers were sent to Rabaul . From there , the Japanese planned to deliver Kawaguchi
  's men to Guadalcanal by destroyers , staging through a Japanese naval base in the
  Shortland Islands . The Japanese destroyers were usually able to make the round
  trip down " The Slot " to Guadalcanal and back in a single night , minimizing their
  exposure to Allied air attack . However , most of the soldiers ' heavy equipment
  and supplies , such as heavy artillery , vehicles , and much food and ammunition
  , could not be taken to Guadalcanal with them . These high @-@ speed destroyer runs
  to Guadalcanal , which occurred throughout the campaign , were later called the
  " Tokyo Express " by Allied forces and " Rat Transportation " by the Japanese .
  The Japanese controlled the seas around the Solomon Islands during the nighttime
  and were not challenged by the Allies . However , any Japanese ship remaining within
  the 200 mi ( 320 km ) range of the aircraft at Henderson Field in daylight was in
  great danger from air attacks
- searchlight . Japanese artillery began shelling the Marine lines , but did little
  damage . At the same time , scattered groups of Kawaguchi 's troops began skirmishing
  with Marines around the ridge . Kawaguchi 's 1st Battalion — led by Major Yukichi
  Kokusho — attacked the Raider 's " C " company between the lagoon and the Lunga
  River , overrunning at least one platoon and forcing the Marine company to fall
  back to the ridge . Kokusho 's unit became entangled with troops from Kawaguchi
  's 3rd Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Kusukichi Watanabe , who were still struggling
  to reach their attack positions , and the resulting confusion effectively stopped
  the Japanese attack on the ridge that night . Kawaguchi , who was having trouble
  locating where he was in relation to the U.S. Marine lines as well as coordinating
  his troops ' attacks , later complained , " Due to the devilish jungle , the brigade
  was scattered all over and was completely beyond my control . In my whole life I
  have never felt so disappointed and helpless . " Twelve U.S. Marines were killed
  ; Japanese casualties are unknown but perhaps somewhat greater . Although both Oka
  in the west and the Kuma unit in the east tried to attack the Marine lines that
  night , they failed to make contact and halted
- 'plus an assortment of light artillery . The night was pitch black , with no moon
  . At 21 : 00 , seven Japanese destroyers briefly bombarded the ridge . Kawaguchi
  ''s attack began just after nightfall , with Kokusho ''s battalion assaulting Raider
  Company B on the Marine right flank , just to the west of the ridge . The force
  of the assault caused Company B to fall back to Hill 123 . Under Marine artillery
  fire , Kokusho reassembled his men and continued his attack . Without pausing to
  try to " roll @-@ up " the other nearby Marine units , whose flanks were now unprotected
  , Kokusho ''s unit surged forward through the swampy lowlands between the ridge
  and the Lunga River , heading for the airfield . Kokusho ''s men came upon a pile
  of Marine supplies and rations . Not having eaten adequately for a couple of days
  , they paused to " gorge themselves " on the " C " and " K " rations . Kokusho ordered
  his men to continue the attack . At about 03 : 00 , he led them against the Marine
  units around the northern portion of the ridge , just short of the airfield , as
  well as Hill 123 . In the heavy fighting that followed , Kokusho and around 100
  of his men were killed ,'
- Hill 123 , Tamura 's battalion began a series of frontal assaults on the hill ,
  charging up the saddle from Hill 80 and up from below the east side of the ridge
  . Under the light of parachute flares dropped by at least one Japanese floatplane
  , the Marines repulsed the first two attacks by Tamura 's men . Tamura 's troops
  hoisted a 75 mm ( 2 @.@ 95 in ) " regimental " gun to the top of Hill 80 in an effort
  to fire it directly at the Marines . This gun , which " could have turned the tide
  in favor of the Japanese , " however , was disabled by a faulty firing pin . At
  midnight , during a short lull in the fighting , Edson ordered Parachute Companies
  B and C to advance from behind Hill 123 to strengthen his left flank . With fixed
  bayonets , the Paramarines swept forward , killing Japanese soldiers who had overrun

  The Japanese attack was
- ( Great Jaguar Paw ) . Chak Tok Ich 'aak built a palace that was preserved and developed
  by later rulers until it became the core of the Central Acropolis . Little is known
  about Chak Tok Ich 'aak except that he was killed on 14 January 378 AD . On the
  same day , Siyah K ’ ak ’ ( Fire Is Born ) arrived from the west , having passed
  through El Peru , a site to the west of Tikal , on 8 January . On Stela 31 he is
  named as " Lord of the West " . Siyah K ’ ak ’ was probably a foreign general serving
  a figure represented by a non @-@ Maya hieroglyph of a spearthrower combined with
  an owl , a glyph that is well known from the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in
  the distant Valley of Mexico . Spearthrower Owl may even have been the ruler of
  Teotihuacan . These recorded events strongly suggest that Siyah K ’ ak ’ led a Teotihuacan
  invasion that defeated the native Tikal king , who was captured and immediately
  executed . Siyah K 'ak ' appears to have been aided by a powerful political faction
  at Tikal itself ; roughly at the time of the conquest , a group of Teotihuacan natives
  were apparently residing near the Lost World complex . He also exerted control over
  other cities in the area , including Uaxactun , where he became
- Calakmul and defeated Tikal , closing the Early Classic . The " Tikal hiatus " refers
  to a period between the late 6th to late 7th century where there was a lapse in
  the writing of inscriptions and large @-@ scale construction at Tikal . In the latter
  half of the 6th century AD , a serious crisis befell the city , with no new stelae
  being erected and with widespread deliberate mutilation of public sculpture . This
  hiatus in activity at Tikal was long unexplained until later epigraphic decipherments
  identified that the period was prompted by Tikal 's comprehensive defeat at the
  hands of Calakmul and the Caracol polity in AD 562 , a defeat that seems to have
  resulted in the capture and sacrifice of the king of Tikal . The badly eroded Altar
  21 at Caracol described how Tikal suffered this disastrous defeat in a major war
  in April 562 . It seems that Caracol was an ally of Calakmul in the wider conflict
  between that city and Tikal , with the defeat of Tikal having a lasting impact upon
  the city . Tikal was not sacked but its power and influence were broken . After
  its great victory , Caracol grew rapidly and some of Tikal 's population may have
  been forcibly relocated there . During the hiatus period , at least one ruler of
  Tikal took refuge with Janaab ' Pakal of Palenque , another of Calakmul 's victims
- at the much diminished city of Tikal , as evidenced by a stela erected in the Great
  Plaza by Jasaw Chan K 'awiil II in 869 . This was the last monument erected at Tikal
  before the city finally fell into silence . The former satellites of Tikal , such
  as Jimbal and Uaxactun , did not last much longer , erecting their final monuments
  in 889 . By the end of the 9th century the vast majority of Tikal 's population
  had deserted the city , its royal palaces were occupied by squatters and simple
  thatched dwellings were being erected in the city 's ceremonial plazas . The squatters
  blocked some doorways in the rooms they reoccupied in the monumental structures
  of the site and left rubbish that included a mixture of domestic refuse and non
  @-@ utilitarian items such as musical instruments . These inhabitants reused the
  earlier monuments for their own ritual activities far removed from those of the
  royal dynasty that had erected them . Some monuments were vandalized and some were
  moved to new locations . Before its final abandonment all respect for the old rulers
  had disappeared , with the tombs of the North Acropolis being explored for jade
  and the easier to find tombs being looted . After 950 , Tikal was all but deserted
  , although a remnant population may have survived in perishable huts interspersed
  among the ruins . Even these

  on vulnerable minds . Public concerns about the potential dangers posed by cults
  date back to the early 1970s , when widespread debate took place about " youth religions
  " such as the Unification Church , ISKCON , Children of God , and the Divine Light
  Mission . The most prominent critics of these new religious movements were the "
  sect commissioners " ( Sektenbeauftragte ) of Germany 's Protestant Churches , who
  also actively promoted the establishment of private " initiatives of parents and
  concerned persons " . Aktion Bildungsinformation ( " Educational Information Campaign
  " ) became an important organization dedicated to opposing Scientology ; taking
  an activist stance , it warned people not to get involved with Scientology , filed
  successful lawsuits against the Church of Scientology over its proselytizing in
  public places , and published an influential book , The Sect of Scientology and
  its Front Organizations . In 1981 , the organization 's founder , Ingo Heinemann
  , became the director of Aktion für geistige und psychische Freiheit ( " Campaign
  for Intellectual and Psychic Freedom " ) , Germany 's most prominent anti @-@ cult
  organization . Warnings from sect experts about the influence of new religious movements
  gained media attention which put political pressure on the government to deal with

  Bill Clinton at a conference in Philadelphia . Travolta later said Clinton assured
  him that he would " really love to help " with the " issue over in Germany with
  Scientology " . According to Travolta , Clinton recalled that " he had a roommate
  years ago who was a Scientologist and had really liked him , and respected his views
  on it " , stating that Scientologists " were given an unfair hand in [ Germany ]
  and that he wanted to fix it " . In September 1997 , John Travolta , Chick Corea
  and fellow Scientologist Isaac Hayes were heard by the Commission on Security and
  Cooperation in Europe ( CSCE , also known as the Helsinki Commission ) , voicing
  their complaints about the treatment of Scientologists in Germany , and had a briefing
  with United States National Security Advisor Sandy Berger , whom Clinton had assigned
  to be " the administration 's Scientology point person " . The German ambassador
  responded with a letter to the CSCE stating that the German government had come
  to the conclusion that Scientology 's " pseudo @-@ scientific courses can seriously

  by shells that detonated prematurely in their barrels . In turn she concentrated
  most of her fire upon the battleships Poltava and Tsesarevich although both ships
  were only lightly damaged by the Japanese shells , which generally failed to penetrate
  any armour and detonated on impact . The ship made the critical hits of the battle
  , however , when two of her 12 @-@ inch shells struck the bridge of Tsesarevich
  , killing the Russian squadron commander , Vice Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft , two of

  ships the names of their captains , and on receiving no answer but a volley of rifle
  fire , he put the town on alert . With the defenders forewarned , Cooke abandoned
  his ruse and after refloating Sybille the following morning , ordered a bombardment
  of the fort protecting the harbour . This had little effect , though later the Spanish
  recovered at least 450 cannonballs from different calibers , and Malcolm then attempted
  an amphibious landing in order to storm the landward side of the fort . The boats
  came under heavy fire , one smashed by a cannonball , killing two and wounding four

- the first to contact the Japanese , carrying out an attack against Japanese positions
  around Dawe 's Creek on 17 April . Supported by a troop of Matilda tanks from the
  2 / 4th Armoured Regiment , an artillery barrage which fired over 700 shells , two
  infantry companies — ' C ' and ' D ' — from the 24th attacked the position while
  another — ' A ' Company — carried out a flanking manoeuvre to cut another track
  further north towards Kindara and Hatai . The left forward company — ' D ' Company
  — reached its objective without trouble ; however , ' C ' Company — on the right
  along with the troop of tanks — came up against stiff Japanese resistance and became
  bogged down . ' A ' Company also became embroiled in heavy fighting along the Hatai
  track . In support of ' A ' Company , Matilidas came forward and raked the jungle
  , hacking through the undergrowth to reveal several Japanese pillboxes , which were
  destroyed by the Australian armour . As night fell , ' C ' Company dug in before
  resuming the attack the next morning . Engineers were brought forward , as was a
  bulldozer , and the gap was bridged . Amidst heavy fighting , the Australians forced
  their way across the creek . By the time that the position had been taken in the

  infantry , as well as a creeping barrage of artillery and mortar fire . With such
  strong support the Japanese offered little resistance and over the course of two
  days the 24th Infantry Battalion covered almost a third of the distance to the Hongorai
  , for just one man wounded . Further progress was made over the next week , but
  on 4 May the advance was slowed when they encountered a roadblock defended by a
  field gun along with a machine gun , mines and other improvised explosive devices
  . After this , the 15th Brigade 's engineer support were called upon to regularly
  carry out route clearance and proving operations as the Japanese became increasingly
  desperate to destroy the Australian armour , to the extent that they were prepared
  to sacrifice an artillery piece in order to lure the Australian tanks into a trap
  where they could be destroyed by mines . The Japanese began to adapt their tactics
  in other ways also . To negate the effectiveness of the Australian tanks , the Japanese
  began to position themselves off the roads , forcing the infantry to fight without
  their armoured support . Additionally , the Japanese began to concentrate their
  artillery with increasing accuracy upon the advancing infantry , which they kept

  had pressed forward again . Advancing with a tank troop in support , they came up
  against a concealed field gun defended by approximately 100 Japanese . After the
  lead Matilda 's machine gun jammed , the field gun opened fire on it , damaging
  it and wounding its crew . Moving around the stricken tank , the second Matilda
  , armed with a howitzer , opened fire and destroyed the field gun before sweeping
  the Japanese defenders from the position . That night , the Japanese artillery opened

  left a local motel , and Olivia finds evidence that points to a past serial murder
  case she and her former partner John Scott were not able to solve . Olivia explains
  to Peter that their murderer would paralyze his victims , young women , then make
  an incision along their face to extract a piece of brain material , killing the
  victim in the process . Walter takes both corpses back to his lab and determines
  that the woman had only been pregnant minutes before giving birth , her child having

  to be careful and that they only need one more woman to complete the process . By
  this time , Charlie has found a recent murder victim killed in the same fashion
  as Olivia 's serial murderer . At Walter 's lab , they identify the pituitary gland
  has been removed . They rationalize the murderer must extract hormones from the
  glands to slow down his own aging process . Walter hypothesizes they can discover
  the location of the crime by looking at the images left in the woman 's optical
  nerves induced by the paralyzing sedative . Borrowing an electronic pulse camera
  from Massive Dynamic , they discover the image of a suspension bridge near Stoughton
  and identify the likely location from which it was viewed — the same warehouse that

  the 1860s to 1900 . In Western Australia , the violence moved north with European

- its own naval vessel , HMCSS Victoria , and its deployment to New Zealand in 1860
  during the First Taranaki War marked the first occasion that an Australian warship
  had been deployed overseas . The colonial navies were expanded greatly in the mid
  @-@ 1880s and consisted of a number of gunboats and torpedo @-@ boats for the defence
  of harbours and rivers , as well as naval brigades to man vessels and forts . Victoria
  became the most powerful of all the colonial navies , with the ironclad HMVS Cerberus
  in service from 1870 , as well as the steam @-@ sail warship HMS Nelson on loan
  from the Royal Navy , three small gunboats and five torpedo @-@ boats . New South
  Wales formed a Naval Brigade in 1863 and by the start of the 20th century had two
  small torpedo @-@ boats and a corvette . The Queensland Maritime Defence Force was
  established in 1885 , while South Australia operated a single ship , HMCS Protector
  . Tasmania had also a small Torpedo Corps , while Western Australia 's only naval
  defences included the Fremantle Naval Artillery . Naval personnel from New South
  Wales and Victoria took part in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in China
  in 1900 , while HMCS Protector was sent by South Australia but saw no action . The
  separate colonies maintained control over their military and naval
- small and lacked blue water capabilities , forcing the separate colonies to subsidise
  the cost of a British naval squadron in their waters for decades . The colonies
  maintained control over their respective navies until 1 March 1901 , when the Commonwealth
  Naval Force was created . This new force also lacked blue water capable ships ,
  and ultimately did not lead to a change in Australian naval policy . In 1907 Prime
  Minister Alfred Deakin and Creswell , while attending the Imperial Conference in
  London , sought the British Government 's agreement to end the subsidy system and
  develop an Australian navy . The Admiralty rejected and resented the challenge ,
  but suggested diplomatically that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would
  be sufficient . Deakin was unimpressed , and in 1908 invited the American Great
  White Fleet to visit Australia . This visit fired public enthusiasm for a modern
  navy and in part led to the order of two 700 @-@ ton River @-@ class destroyers
  . The surge in German naval construction prompted the Admiralty to change their
  position however and the Royal Australian Navy was subsequently formed in 1911 ,
  absorbing the Commonwealth Naval Force . On 4 October 1913 , the new fleet steamed
  through Sydney Heads , consisting of the battlecruiser HMAS Australia , three light
  cruisers , and three destroyers , while several other ships were still under construction

- occupation of Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( BCOF
  ) , which included forces from Australia , Britain , India and New Zealand . At
  its height in 1946 the Australian component consisted of an infantry brigade , four
  warships and three fighter squadrons , totalling 13 @,@ 500 personnel . The Australian
  Army component initially consisted of the 34th Brigade which arrived in Japan in
  February 1946 and was based in Hiroshima Prefecture . The three infantry battalions
  raised for occupation duties were designated the 1st , 2nd and 3rd battalions of
  the Royal Australian Regiment in 1949 , and the 34th Brigade became the 1st Brigade
  when it returned to Australia in December 1948 , forming the basis of the post @-@
  war Regular Army . From that time the Australian Army contribution to the occupation
  of Japan was reduced to a single under @-@ strength battalion . Australian forces
  remained until September 1951 when the BCOF ceased operations , although by the
  time the majority of units had been committed to the fighting on the Korean peninsular
  following the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 . The RAAF component consisted
  of Nos. 76 , 77 and 82 Squadrons as part of No. 81 Wing RAAF flying P @-@ 51 Mustangs
  , initially based at Bofu from March 1946 , before transferring to Iwakuni in 1948
  . However , by 1950 only No. 77 Squadron
- in retreat following the Inchon landings . As a part of the invasion force under
  the UN Supreme Commander , General Douglas MacArthur , the battalion moved north
  and was involved in its first major action at Battle of Yongju near Pyongyang on
  22 October , before advancing towards the Yalu River . Further successful actions
  followed at Kujin on 25 – 26 October 1950 and at Chongju on 29 October 1950 . North
  Korean casualties were heavy , while Australian losses included their commanding
  officer , Lieutenant Colonel Charles Green , who was wounded in the stomach by artillery
  fire after the battle and succumbed to his wounds and died two days later on 1 November
  . Meanwhile , during the last weeks of October the Chinese had moved 18 divisions
  of the People 's Volunteer Army across the Yalu River to reinforce the remnants
  of the KPA . Undetected by US and South Korean intelligence , the 13th Army Group
  crossed the border on 16 October and penetrated up to 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) into
  North Korea , and were reinforced in early November by 12 divisions from the 9th
  Army Group ; in total 30 divisions composed of 380 @,@ 000 men . 3 RAR fought its
  first action against the Chinese at Pakchon on 5 November . The fighting cost the
  battalion heavily and despite halting a Chinese division the new battalion commander
  was
- with the US 173rd Airborne Brigade in Bien Hoa province in June 1965 and it subsequently
  fought a number of significant actions , including Gang Toi , Operation Crimp and
  Suoi Bong Trang . In March 1966 , the Australian government announced the deployment
  of a brigade @-@ sized unit — the 1st Australian Task Force ( 1 ATF ) — to replace
  1 RAR . Included were a large number of conscripts , under the increasingly controversial
  National Service Scheme . Consisting of two infantry battalions as well as armour
  , aviation , artillery and other support arms , the task force was assigned primary
  responsibility for its own area and was based at Nui Dat , in Phuoc Tuy Province
  . Included were the Iroquois helicopters of No. 9 Squadron RAAF . At the Battle
  of Long Tan on 18 August 1966 , D Company , 6 RAR with considerable artillery support
  held off and defeated a Viet Cong force that was at least six times bigger than
  itself . 18 Australians were killed and 24 wounded , while 245 communist dead were
  later recovered from the battlefield . The battle allowed the Australians to gain
  dominance over Phuoc Tuy Province and 1 ATF was not fundamentally challenged again

  forces , police and government officials from East Timor , UNAMET re @-@ established
  its headquarters in Dili on 28 September . On 19 October 1999 , Indonesia formally
  recognised the result of the referendum and shortly thereafter a UN peacekeeping
  force , the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor ( UNTAET )
  was established , becoming fully responsible for the administration of East Timor
  during its transition to independence . The hand @-@ over of command of military
  operations from INTERFET to UNTAET was completed on 28 February 2000 . Australia
  continued to support the UN peacekeeping operation with between 1 @,@ 500 and 2
  @,@ 000 personnel , as well as landing craft and Blackhawk helicopters and remained
  the largest contributor of personnel to the peacekeeping mission . During these
  operations Australian forces regularly clashed with pro @-@ Indonesian militia and
  on a number of occasions Indonesian forces as well , especially along the border
  with West Timor . Significant actions occurred in Suai , Mota 'ain and at Aidabasalala
  in October 1999 . However , with the security situation stabilised the bulk of the
  Australian and UN forces were withdrawn by 2005 . Two Australians died from non

  @-@ 2005 to fight against the Taliban . Over time the Australian commitment has
  grown , with the addition of further ground forces in the form of a Reconstruction
  Task Force from 2006 to provide security , reconstruction and to mentor and train
  the Afghan National Army . Australia has also contributed a frigate and two AP @-@
  3C Orion surveillance aircraft and three C @-@ 130 Hercules transport aircraft to
  international operations in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean since 2001 , supporting
  both the operations in Afghanistan and those in Iraq under Operation Catalyst .

  . So little wonder that on occasion of the dinner here pictured - when the prize
  dish was a splendid homemade mince pie - the Gales were ever looking after the need
  of the said pie . First Mamma Gale would tiptoe to the table whereupon it sat in

  a stir ; finally Daughter Gale would have to come over and honor it likewise . Then

  fact , with a mince pie for a basis the flavor comes to resemble brandy very strongly
  by the time that the cook , the maid and the mistress of the house and her daughter
  have added the proper proportion of flavoring , neither one knowing that the others
  have done likewise . The humor in this piece centers around this pie . What happened
  to the guests who partook of it certainly draws upon the imagination . Imagine eight

  rock in their youth in the mid @-@ 1970s . Bono realised that U2 " had no tradition
  " , and he felt as if they " were from outer space " . This inspired him to write
  the blues @-@ influenced song " Silver and Gold " , which he recorded with Richards
  and Ronnie Wood . It was re @-@ recorded by U2 for the " Where the Streets Have
  No Name " single while the band returned to Dublin during in May 1987 during a break
  between the first and second legs of The Joshua Tree Tour . The song was described
  by Musician as " tough and raw , with Bono in husky and confident voice , underpinned
  by a sinuous bass line , and with The Edge demonstrating his newfound prowess in

  effect as giving it a " silly , Charlie Chaplin quality " — and Bono often acknowledged
  his younger self on the video screens . This video would make a return during performances
  on the 2010 and 2011 legs of the U2 360 ° Tour . Some of the Zoo TV performances
  of the song had a more electronic dance music arrangement that bore a resemblance
  to the Pet Shop Boys '' synthpop cover of the song ( titled " Where the Streets

    was a lapse in the writing of inscriptions and large @-@ scale construction at
    Tikal . In the latter half of the 6th century AD , a serious crisis befell the
    city , with no new stelae being erected and with widespread deliberate mutilation
    of public sculpture . This hiatus in activity at Tikal was long unexplained until
    later epigraphic decipherments identified that the period was prompted by Tikal
    's comprehensive defeat at the hands of Calakmul and the Caracol polity in AD
    562 , a defeat that seems to have resulted in the capture and sacrifice of the
    king of Tikal . The badly eroded Altar 21 at Caracol described how Tikal suffered
    this disastrous defeat in a major war in April 562 . It seems that Caracol was
    an ally of Calakmul in the wider conflict between that city and Tikal , with the
    defeat of Tikal having a lasting impact upon the city . Tikal was not sacked but
    its power and influence were broken . After its great victory , Caracol grew rapidly
    and some of Tikal 's population may have been forcibly relocated there . During
    the hiatus period , at least one ruler of Tikal took refuge with Janaab ' Pakal

    of Tikal , such as Jimbal and Uaxactun , did not last much longer , erecting their
    final monuments in 889 . By the end of the 9th century the vast majority of Tikal
    's population had deserted the city , its royal palaces were occupied by squatters
    and simple thatched dwellings were being erected in the city 's ceremonial plazas
    . The squatters blocked some doorways in the rooms they reoccupied in the monumental
    structures of the site and left rubbish that included a mixture of domestic refuse

    reused the earlier monuments for their own ritual activities far removed from

    for the old rulers had disappeared , with the tombs of the North Acropolis being

    was all but deserted , although a remnant population may have survived in perishable

    a return to form , stating " she has acute comic timing and hilariously enacts
    alarming sexual hungers " . Ebert called Horrible Bosses " cheerful and wicked
    " . Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly reacted positively , calling the
    film " a bouncy , well @-@ built , delightfully nasty tale of resentment , desperation
    , and amoral revenge " and complimented the casting of the protagonists and antagonists
    . The A.V. Club 's Nathan Rabin also praised the cast , stating that the picture
    " succeeds almost entirely on the chemistry of its three leads , who remain likeable
    even while resorting to homicide " , adding the " acting more than compensates
    for the film 's other failings . " Rabin singled out Day 's performance as " a
    potent illustration of how a brilliant character actor with a spark of madness
    can elevate a ramshackle lowbrow farce into a solid mainstream comedy through
    sheer force of charisma . " Edward Douglas of ComingSoon.net credited director
    Seth Gordon with having assembled " the perfect cast " , claiming " the six leads

    of Bateman and Day . The dialogue was also lauded by Bowles , which commented
    that " Seth Gordon has a deft touch with water @-@ cooler talk — even when the
    water cooler might be spiked with poison . " Leonard Maltin of indieWire considered
    Day to have had the " breakout role " and offered praise to the performances of
    the cast , but lamented the lack of screen time for Farrell 's character . Maltin
    concluded " the movie has just enough raunchiness to identify it as a 2011 comedy
    , just enough cleverness to admire , and just the right camaraderie among its
    three male stars , which turns out to be the movie ’ s greatest strength . " Rolling
    Stone 's Peter Travers gave kudos to the " killer cast " , with specific credit
    given to Bateman and Day , but was critical of the movie , stating " it wussies

    Bateman , Aniston and Spacey for their performances . O 'Hehir was however critical

    Honeycutt responded negatively , stating the jokes failed to be funny , stating
    " Seth Gordon shows no flair for turning the absurdities and cartoonish characters
    in the script ... into anything more than a collection of moments in search of
    laughs . " Karina Longworth of The Village Voice was critical of the premise ,
    which she felt lacked any legitimate " rage " against the characters ' bosses
    , stating " ... there 's every sign that , even without these particular emasculators
    , Dale , Kurt and Nick would still be — for lack of a better word — total pussies
    . " Longworth felt that the humor was " rarely actually laugh @-@ out @-@ loud
    funny , and never truly dark or daring " . She particularly criticized the all
